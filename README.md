The GazeGenius application encompasses functionalities such as Visual Fatigue Disorder (VFD), Contrast Sensitivity testing, Color Blindness assessment, Eye Games tailored for children, and a holistic Application Management system.

## App Features


## Visual Fatigue Disorder (VFD)
Visual Fatigue Disorder (VFD) is a condition characterized by excessive strain on the visual system due to prolonged exposure to digital screens, inadequate lighting, and poor visual habits. It can lead to symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, difficulty focusing, and dry eyes.

The proposed "Visual Fatigue Index Test" aims to assess a user's susceptibility to VFD by evaluating their ability to maintain comfortable and focused vision during extended screen use. This test includes components like dynamic focus challenges, eye tracking and blink rate measurement, colour temperature preferences, reading comprehension speed assessment, and a visual habit survey.

Based on the user's responses and interactions with the test, the app generates a Visual Fatigue Index score and offers personalized recommendations to mitigate the risk of VFD. These recommendations may include adjusting screen brightness, taking regular breaks, following the 20-20-20 rule, and optimizing lighting conditions to promote healthier visual habits.

## Contrast Sensitivity
Contrast sensitivity involves managing the visual perception of differences in brightness or contrast levels. This includes tasks such as adding new test images, retrieving existing images for testing, updating or replacing images, and removing outdated ones.

## Color Blindness
Color blindness management focuses on handling tests and images related to assessing and addressing color vision deficiencies. It includes adding new test plates and color images, retrieving them for testing, updating or modifying existing images, and removing unnecessary or outdated ones.

## Eye Games for Children
Eye games for children are interactive activities designed for kids under 8 years old to promote healthy visual development. Managing these games includes adding new games to the library, retrieving the list of available games, updating game content or graphics for better engagement, and removing outdated or less effective games.

## Overall Application Management (Profile Management)
This involves the broader management of the entire application, including user profiles and data. It includes tasks like adding new user accounts, retrieving user data, updating user profiles and test results, and removing user accounts and associated data upon request or deactivation.
