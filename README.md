# GazeGenius

The GazeGenius application encompasses functionalities such as Visual Fatigue Disorder (VFD), Contrast Sensitivity testing, Color Blindness assessment, Eye Games tailored for children, and a holistic Application Management system.

## App Features


## Visual Fatigue Disorder (VFD)
Visual Fatigue Disorder (VFD) is a condition characterized by excessive strain on the visual system due to prolonged exposure to digital screens, inadequate lighting, and poor visual habits. It can lead to symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, difficulty focusing, and dry eyes.

The proposed "Visual Fatigue Index Test" aims to assess a user's susceptibility to VFD by evaluating their ability to maintain comfortable and focused vision during extended screen use. This test includes components like dynamic focus challenges, eye tracking and blink rate measurement, colour temperature preferences, reading comprehension speed assessment, and a visual habit survey.

Based on the user's responses and interactions with the test, the app generates a Visual Fatigue Index score and offers personalized recommendations to mitigate the risk of VFD. These recommendations may include adjusting screen brightness, taking regular breaks, following the 20-20-20 rule, and optimizing lighting conditions to promote healthier visual habits.

## Contrast Sensitivity
Contrast sensitivity refers to the ability of an individual's eyes to distinguish between objects with different levels of contrast or brightness. In the context of the Ninduki application, contrast sensitivity management involves tasks related to the images used for testing and improving this visual function.

## Color Blindness
Color blindness, or color vision deficiency, is a condition where individuals have difficulty perceiving certain colors accurately. Ninduki's color blindness management involves handling the tests and images used to assess and address color vision deficiencies.

## Eye Games for Children
Eye games for children are interactive activities designed to engage and entertain kids while also promoting healthy visual development. Bimsara's responsibility is to curate and maintain a collection of eye games suitable for children under 8 years old.

## Overall Application Management (Profile Management)
This encompasses the broader aspects of managing the entire application, particularly user profiles and data. Omesh is responsible for tasks related to user accounts, test results, feedback, and overall system functionality.
